== Spring cloud framework

Before you start building microservices, there are a few things you need to consider and you should change your mindset before saying No.

==== Setup

You need to clone the training repository on your local machine:

	git clone https://github.com/mihaita-tinta/training-spring-boot-k8s.git


==== Hello Config Server, Hello Service Discovery

Information regarding the Spring Cloud framework is availble on the official website: http://projects.spring.io/spring-cloud/spring-cloud.html

So, the Config Server can tell the microservices what is their configuration and the Eureka Server is used by the microservices
to register and tell other microservices they can be invoked.

Jhipster Registry (https://github.com/jhipster/jhipster-registry) is a really cool project that uses the Spring Cloud functionality of the Eureka Server and Config server into a single application.
So, to run it into Kubernetes we need the deployment YAML file and apply it with the kubectl command

The YAML files can be found in the /part2/k8s/registry folder

We need to delete everything from part 1 (Don't forget to run minikube and connect to docker)
----
	kubectl delete --all deployment --namespace=default
	kubectl delete --all svc --namespace=default
----

We will connect to the https://github.com/mihaita-tinta/configuration-server-resources.git repository
and you should change it to your own location:

----
        - name: SPRING_CLOUD_CONFIG_SERVER_GIT_URI
          value: https://github.com/mihaita-tinta/configuration-server-resources.git

----

Deploy the jhipster-registry app:

----
	kubectl apply -f .\part2\k8s\registry\
----

To access the web app from your favorite browser you should run:

----

	minikube service jhipster-registry
	
----

Get into the container and check the running java process:
	
----
	kubectl exec -it jhipster-registry-0 -- /bin/sh
	ps ax|grep java
----

==== Register the first microservice

The gateway app was generated using the jHipster generator. More info here: http://www.jhipster.tech/api-gateway/

Create the docker image for the gateway app.

----
 cd .\part2\gateway\
 .\mvnw clean package -Dprod docker:build

	kubectl get pods
